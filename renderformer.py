# Ray Bundle Embedding. Each ray bundle is a collection of 8 Ã— 8
# rays that go through the center of the pixels of the corresponding
# pixel patch. Because the scene is expressed in camera coordinates
# in the view-dependent stage, the origin of all rays is (0, 0, 0). We
# therefore, only need to encode the normalized directions of each
# ray. We stack the 64 direction vectors in a 192-dimensional vector
# which is subsequently encoded by a single linear layer followed by
# RMS-Normalization into a 768-dimensional token.
